## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

## Changelog

### New Features

- Added `createTransformThenValidate` function: This new function allows you to create a transformation and validation chain for input values. It provides a fluent API to easily chain multiple transformations and validations together.

- Added callback support for each `createTransformThenValidate` and `createValidation` function: Now you can provide a callback function for each transformation and validation step. This callback function will be executed during the transformation or validation process, allowing you to perform custom logic or actions.

### Enhancements

- Improved TypeScript type support: The library now provides even stronger TypeScript type definitions, ensuring better type safety and improved developer experience.

- Updated documentation and examples: The documentation and examples have been updated to reflect the new features and provide clearer usage instructions.

- Bug fixes and performance improvements: Various bugs have been fixed, and performance optimizations have been made to enhance the overall reliability and efficiency of the library.

We hope that these new features and enhancements will further empower developers in performing data transformation and validation tasks efficiently and effectively.
